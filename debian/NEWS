xbmc (2:12.0~git20121119.22795bc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * For XBMC Frodo (v12.0), XBMC will be built and run using XBMC's internal
    fork of FFMpeg. The specific branch that the fork is forked from is
    FFMpeg's 10.2 branch.
    .
    The decision was made to use the internal copy of FFMpeg because a
    large amount of work would be required in order to get XBMC building
    and running with both FFMpeg and Libav. In the case of Debian and it's
    derivatives, there would have been no benefit in getting XBMC at least
    working with FFMpeg installed as system libraries, since Debian
    currently only has Libav.
